# Julia Fundamentals

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Julia. This journey is largely inspired by the practical and insightful approach of the "Statistics with Julia" book. Here, I explore the core concepts of Julia programming, particularly its applications in statistics and data analysis.

## About the Repository

This repository is a collection of my personal learning experiences with Julia. It's structured to be both informative for those new to Julia and a reference for those who want more depth in specific areas.

### Contents

- `Crash Course by Examples`: This folder is the heart of the repository. It contains Julia code snippets and mini-projects where I've implemented popular problems and concepts. These examples are designed to give a hands-on feel for Julia's capabilities, especially in statistical analysis and data handling.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Julia programming language.
- Explore Julia's powerful features for statistical analysis.
- Implement common statistical methods and models in Julia.

## Resources

- Book: [Statistics with Julia](https://statisticswithjulia.org/)

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse, clone, or fork this repository for your learning or reference. Each folder contains separate Julia files with comments explaining the code and concepts.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, suggestions, corrections, or contributions to improve the content are always welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

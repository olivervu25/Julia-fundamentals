# Julia Fundamentals

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Julia. This journey is largely inspired by the practical and insightful approach of the "Statistics with Julia" book. Here, I explore the core concepts of Julia programming, particularly its applications in statistics and data analysis.

## About the Repository

This repository is a collection of my personal learning experiences with Julia. It's structured to be both informative for those new to Julia and a reference for those who want more depth in specific areas.

### Contents

### `Crash Course by Examples`
This folder contains Julia code snippets and mini-projects based on Part 1 of the "Statistics with Julia" book. It's a great starting point for those new to Julia, offering practical examples and problems to understand the basics of the language, particularly in the context of statistical analysis and data handling.

### Simulation of Dynamic Models
This folder is inspired by Part 10 of the "Statistics with Julia" book and focuses on simulating different models using various simulation methods. Here, you'll find more advanced applications of Julia in modeling dynamic systems, showcasing the language's power and flexibility in dealing with complex simulations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Julia programming language.
- Explore Julia's powerful features for statistical analysis.
- Implement common statistical methods and models in Julia.
